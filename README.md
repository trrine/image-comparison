# Keypoint-Based Image Comparison Using SIFT
This program utilises the SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm to detect keypoints in images, which not only charactise individual objects but also entire images. The user can provide one image as input and have the image displayed with detected keypoints highlighted. Additionally, the user can input a list of images, and the program will use the detected keypoints to compare the images and print a dissimilarity matrix.
